    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="meta">Introduction</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>My name is Diego Silva. This website is my way of documenting my experiences, traits, and daily life so that professionals who wishes to understand me better, can see a full picture.</p>
    <br>
     <p>I am 37 years old, I have a social/communication problem and high sensitivity. mainly after stressful periods that are usually caused by unexpected situations, noises, smells, etc.. for example. cigarrete smell. it triggers other senses. Things might become louder, brighter. I get really irritated with it. If I'm in the overground, for example, I might move seats or leave at the next station.  It might happen also at any time , even after waking up. Maybe my light and fan are triggering it because things sound louder when I wake up. I think I can feel or experience the world in general with a lot more intensity than most people. Even nature is experienced with highest intensity from my perspective. I think some of it has to do with predictability. For example , right now I live on a flat with aircrafts flying over it, landing and departing from Heathrow or flying above it on a route somewhere else (stansted , for example at 15k feet) then I'm memorizing flying paths and airplane models based on its engines because of the noise. it wakes me up a lot and I get anxious.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>At work I get exposed on a daily basis because I need time to recover. I can't stay an entire shift of work without small pauses for recovering. I take small breaks in the toilet(covering ears, eyes and taking breaths , sometimes blowing my shirt whenn I am really overwhelmed.  I might cry sometimes because of it , but I hold and I think this will have some impact in the future. During break time I sit by myself wearing earphones. I am a literal person. my manager or team leader have to make sure i understand properly the task , but it gets done properly and usually looks better than they imagined it. I got pictures on my phone. My manager told me that all team is really happy with me and that I might wear earphones during the whole shift in case I bring a letter from the doctor. they all notice i get irritated bwith the music from the supermarket. the lights and talks . I called a few people lazy on their faces. I cant stand injustice. I feel really bad when injustice happens. I never do any wrong. </p>
     <br>
     <p>My main focus in life since 2023 has been programming. I spend most of my free time coding, solving Rubik’s cubes, or engaging in puzzles. These focused interests are not just hobbies — they help me regulate emotions, reduce anxiety, and give structure to my days. I am very good at solving problems, and managers often ask for my opinion on important tasks.</p>
      <br>
     <p>I experience significant sensory sensitivities (light, sound, touch, smell, and food textures) and often rely on routines and repetitive behaviors to cope. I can also daydream a lot . Unexpected changes, social events, and noisy environments can overwhelm me and lead to exhaustion, anxiety, or emotional outbursts.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Social communication has always been difficult for me. I often struggle to know when to speak, I speak over the person having a dialogue with me,  misunderstand jokes, and avoid eye contact. I usually hide my real feelings at work but then feel drained and need long periods of recovery alone. I have very limited friendships, prefer solitude, and often rely on repetitive actions like rocking, spinning objects, or solving cubes to calm myself.</p>
      <br>
     <p>Throughout my life I have had unusual sensory experiences. For exemple, I talk to myself a lot, I even listen to voices from my head as if it was real ( I know it's not real ) the voices police my actions. For example, When I'm being loud I can hear someone else's voice saying I'm being loud. When I wake up I can hear sometimes my own mother's voice saying ' he woke up '. I had frequent difficulties with regulating emotions. I never sleep properly. I usually wake up 4 or 5 times per night. I solve rubiks at 3am, take more clonazepam, read books, enter chat rooms in order to try to sleep. Ambient music, cooling fan frequency, socket yellow light, cover my eyes. I sometimes feel hopeless and anxious about the future, but I also continue moving forward — working, coding, and trying to build a stable life.</p>
      <br>
     <p>This website collects my interests, traits, memories, photos, and daily journal entries.</p>
     <br>
     <p>This account is not exhaustive — including my entire life would be too long. Some moments are omitted, and certain sensations or thoughts may be missing. I experienced depression, anxiety, and panic attacks during my teenage years, and I have a history of suicide attempts. For example, when I was around 6th grade I developed panick attacks. I had to go to school by myself. I used to wait for certain buses because of its noises and in my mind I expected from myself more than I was doing. I thought people were staring at me at all times and I felt as being analysed by strangers and not knowing how to react to it. I used to get to school already exhausted and with more crisis happening there. The class lights were fluorescent and it was really noisy. I used to request to leave to the toilet and then call my parents to call the school so I could leave. I had many episodes in different schools, shopping centres, churches,  trains , family breakfast, etc... irritation mostly,  but lights brighter and sounds get louder. I always during my entire life complained with my family because they shout my name . it happens with others as well. snell also triggers me. These symptoms have fluctuated over time and are associated with my condition.</p>

<p><strong>0–5 years (1988–1993)</strong><br>
Early sensory sensitivities, selective eating, and limited social interaction.</p>

<p>I walked within the expected developmental period, but I frequently walked on my tiptoes. My mother and Dr. Valeria considered using a corrective boot at the time. My aunt, who was an evangelical missionary, prayed with her hands on my head because she believed I had demons. My grandfather, who came from a rural and poor background, called me “gay.”</p>

<p>I was highly sensitive to noise. My parents described me as “explosive” because I frequently complained about sounds. My sister said I was annoying. I often spun in circles until I fell. As the youngest child, I felt lonely and usually stayed out of group games. When I went outside, it was mostly with my sister, and I would sit apart and wait while she played rather than joining in.</p>

<p>
I attended a small neighborhood school founded by my mother, where I learned to read and write. 
My social interactions were minimal. On one occasion, I hit other children after observing a popular classmate doing so, but my mother intervened and corrected my behavior.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; padding:10px; background:rgba(255,255,0,0.08); border-left:3px solid #d5ec53;">
<strong>Update (added later):</strong> I had a conversation with my mother during holidays in Lisbon, 
and she explained that I used to hit other children mainly because I did not know how to play with them, 
rather than copying another child.

</p>

<p>I had significant food sensitivities. I vomited after eating certain foods (such as soursop, guava, jackfruit, or when exposed to strong oil smells). I avoided many foods due to texture, including coconut chunks, mango, pineapple, grapes, pear, kiwi, and several other fruits, and this continues into adulthood.<br>
I avoid watermelon because of the seeds, as I feel uncertain about their location. The same applies to grapes, even though they usually contain only one seed. To this day, I avoid eating foods unless I am fully aware of their contents. I avoid many foods specifically because of seeds. I only started eating olives at age 30.</p>

    <h2>5–10 years (1993–1998)</h2>
    <div class="meta">Keyboard, bedroom, advanced studies, asthma episode.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
<p><strong>5–10 years (1993–1998)</strong><br>
Intense focus on keyboard, preference for solitude, advanced academic performance, and asthma-related episodes.</p>

<p>Until the age of nine, I had birthday parties each year, but I often found them overwhelming. I would cry during surprise parties, shout, and become distressed. I remember one birthday when I was taken to someone else's house and saw people waiting to clap and sing “Happy Birthday.” I did not cry because of the celebration itself, but because there were many people and I strongly disliked surprises. When I turned nine, I asked my mother to stop organizing parties and instead give me a keyboard. From that point onward, the birthday parties stopped.</p>

<p>I received a keyboard and taught myself to play. I spent countless hours alone in my bedroom practicing, a pattern that continued until I was 18 years old. I made some friends and occasionally played football, but I was rarely chosen for teams. As a result, I often returned to playing alone.</p>

<p>I frequently fell off my bicycle and still have a scar on my foot from one of those accidents.</p>

<p>I had a childhood friend named Adriel who lived next door, but his closest friend was Bruno. They watched Dragon Ball Z, which I did not. I missed many common childhood experiences such as cartoons, television shows, and video games, and participated very little in them. I stood out academically for having high grades and often studied material in advance, before it was covered in class.</p>

<p>Around age 10, I remember hearing voices. During this period, I had asthma and was once hospitalized after nearly suffocating at the beach. My father helped calm me, and we arrived safely at the hospital. One memory that stands out is when a child at a local corner shop told me he wished he had the same Portuguese vocabulary as me while we were eating crisps. I felt extremely proud and validated that day.</p>

<p>At night, the nebuliser was always prepared for me. Around 3 a.m., I would wake up and quietly go to the living room to use it. The mist eased the tightness in my chest, allowing me to return to sleep. These nights felt long and silent, but the routine provided a sense of relief and control.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I felt afraid of the toys while walking to the nebuliser and needed to wake one of my parents to stay with me briefly. Occasionally, my sister or brother would go instead. Even now, I still recall my mother’s voice saying, “He woke up,” when I wake during the night or early morning, as she used to say this when I had asthma episodes. At the time, it was referred to as “nervous asthma.”</p>

<p>When I wake up, sounds initially seem significantly louder than normal, approximately two to three times more intense. Over a few minutes, this sensation gradually decreases. The same occurs with bright white lights. I remember shouting to have lights turned off and often using the nebuliser in the dark due to light sensitivity.</p>

<p>I was originally left-handed but was trained to use my right hand. I still predominantly use my left leg. I was frequently instructed to look at the camera and smile during photographs. Even during my British citizenship ceremony and other formal events, I experienced difficulty with photographers, who sometimes perceived me as rude due to my discomfort and difficulty following these social expectations.</p>

    <h2>10–15 years (1998–2003)</h2>

  <div class="content">
 <p><strong>10–15 years (1998–2003)</strong><br>
Anxiety and panic episodes; sensory overload; social difficulties; intense ideological interests; use of music for regulation.</p>

<p>During this period, I became strongly influenced by rebellion and anarcho-punk readings. One book led me to several others, and these ideas shaped much of my early adolescence. At school, I sometimes played unusual pranks and spoke very directly, which caused social conflicts and loss of friendships. At Mazarelo School, I once threw a chair at another student. On another occasion, I left a note on a teacher’s desk saying “Happy Teacher’s Day,” with an offensive word written inside. This resulted in being sent to the principal’s office.</p>

<p>I later transferred to Anglo Líder School, where I began experiencing significant anxiety and panic attacks, including sweating, dizziness, and fatigue. I frequently left school before classes began. I believe these crises were related to traveling alone to school in a noisy city environment. I preferred specific buses based on their sound characteristics.</p>

<p>In 1998, my parents traveled to Atlanta and brought me a Discman. I carried it daily, despite its weight, as a way to block out street noise. I listened to music continuously until the teacher entered the classroom, using it as a coping mechanism for sensory overload.</p>

<p>The school administration referred me to a psychologist for assessment. She showed me pictures of butterflies, lions, and other images. I did not fully understand the purpose of the evaluation and have not researched it since. Due to prolonged absences related to anxiety and panic attacks, I failed an entire academic year. Classmates referred to me as “tourist” or “the mute kid.” I frequently daydreamed, and when I returned to awareness, I would sometimes notice others laughing. Panic episodes could occur in various settings, including the street, bus, underground, shopping mall, or during family meals. I sought enclosed and quiet spaces, most commonly bathrooms, to regulate myself.</p>

<p>The school administration requested that I transfer to another school. My mother refused, stating that she had three children enrolled there and would have to remove all of us. It was a low-cost private school. During one episode, I told a history teacher to “f.off” in front of the class. The context was that classmates were being loud after break, and when the teacher entered shouting loudly at the class to be quiet, I reacted by shouting back. I believe I was highly stressed and overwhelmed at the time.</p>

<p>Common triggers included prolonged unwanted conversations, loud environments, and general sensory overload. During some panic episodes, I heard voices of my parents similar to those from my childhood asthma episodes. These voices were not harmful or commanding but appeared linked to memory. During this time, I developed strong auditory skills by playing music by ear. I never learned to read sheet music.</p>

<p>As a child, I cut my parakeets’ wings because I did not understand that it would hurt them. One of them bled significantly, which caused me intense guilt. I cared for it until it healed and later released all of them. I never repeated this behavior. I preferred keeping fish and spent long periods observing them in the aquarium. During childhood, I felt a sense of identification with them.</p>

<p>Photographs (10–15 years): I do not have photographs from this period, as my former girlfriend burned my photo album, and many images were lost.</p>

<p><strong>I repaid the loan and supported myself studying and working.</strong> I <strong>used drugs</strong> before knowing I needed medication, which led to <strong>severe depression and daily suicidal thoughts</strong>. I attended a church (Vine Church Atlanta — Pastor Napoleon), <strong>played keyboard</strong>, and <strong>converted; I remain Christian</strong>.

  <p>Back in Brazil at 19, I had <strong>difficulty adapting</strong>; I <strong>stayed locked in my room</strong>, with my keyboard from the U.S., chats, and alcohol. Continued with psychiatrist (clonazepam and fluoxetine); helped a bit but I remained <strong>anxious, isolated, and exhausted</strong>.</p>
<br>
<p>I had 25 capsules of clonazepan and a bottle of vodka when a friend of mine died. By the time I thought that would be enough to kill me. Slept for 18/19h and woke up with nausea.</p>
<br>  
  <p> I used to go to a bar called ' metal bar ' where they played metal. Spent a few years going there. Never made a single friend. I was always the one aside everywhere. </p>
  <br>    
<p>I focused on <strong>studies (university, courses, MBA)</strong>, tried jobs; <strong>social demands were challenging</strong>. <strong>Routines had to be well-structured</strong>; I developed <strong>rigid, repetitive organization</strong> to manage anxiety. Worked as administrative assistant at Davilla Hospital (was fired) and Arts do Imaginário (was called <strong>“weird”</strong> — I <strong>took it literally</strong> and handled poorly).</p>
<br>
<p>I had a girlfriend and engagement for 5 years; at the end, she said she never loved me. She called me “Bob” (from daydream cartoon) and “crazy” weekly. She wanted many <strong>outings (malls, shows), where I felt extremely uncomfortable due to noise, crowds, and information overload</strong>. After the breakup, she commented on my <strong>tendency to overanalyze</strong>. I have a <strong>problem dressing up according to the weather</strong>.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="content">
<p><strong>I stayed at home a lot.</strong> I worked at a hotel as a night auditor (documents, invoices, payments). I became a <strong>night supervisor; few arrivals/departures — bureaucratic profile</strong>. I was <strong>dismissed in 2015 after the hotel was sold and conflicts with the new management</strong>.</p>
<br>

<p>A car accident was caused by me <strong>trying to end my life</strong>. I was gonna run against a wall when another car invaded my line trying to park. I was so fast he haven't noticed me. so I crashed on him and the wall after.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>I always wanted to go to London. I decided to go (either that or end my life after so many losses).</strong> I came with my Portuguese brother-in-law (I have Portuguese citizenship since childhood; at the time the UK was in the EU). <strong>Adaptation was very difficult: alcohol, frustrations, feelings, suicidal thoughts.</strong></p>
<br>

<p><strong>I didn’t eat much, didn’t know the food, and found the diversity and the noise of the underground strange.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>In 2018, friends organized the 'Contradiction Party', a gathering where I was the theme of the celebration. I was no longer living in Brazil, as I had moved to the UK in 2016, and I only found out about it through a photo someone sent to me. I consider many variables at the same time and may change my opinion as new information emerges. <strong>This shows again how people view me as different everywhere I go.</strong> I know there is something wrong, just don't know what.</p>

    <h2>30–35 years (2018–2023+)</h2>
    <div class="meta">Routine in London, work, software course, British citizenship.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
  <p>For years I <strong>only used the bus because it was quieter</strong>; I took the underground only 3 years after moving (<strong>noise, crowds, heat</strong>). <strong>Always with headphones.</strong> I bought a motorcycle for a few months, but sold it due to the chaos.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Repetitive diet (usually one meal per day).</strong> <strong>I kept using headphones.</strong> I took a day trip to Brighton following a friend on a motorcycle (major achievement, me on a 125cc with an L plate).</p>
<br>

<p>I worked nights at a supermarket. <strong>Switching to day shifts was difficult.</strong> I opted for a £13,000 redundancy package and left.</p>
<br>

<p>Then, a hotel - using Opera. Before leaving the supermarket, the government funded a software development course (Tech Talent Academy, UK). Since then, my <strong>main focus has been programming and Rubik's cubes.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>The hotel provided lodging; I left in less than a year and returned to the supermarket at the end of 2024. I <strong>still struggle to adapt to daytime work, with lots of talking and small talk.</strong> I usually <strong>help guests with excellence and then pretend to do something else in order to make them go away.</strong> Some guests have good topics and the opposite happens. I get interested. <strong>Sometimes I ask to leave early.</strong> I have reorganized departments (sales increased ~6x), received awards and bonuses; I get emails from leadership, but <strong>didn’t take a position due to social demands and my direct communication style.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>I am creating my own company (coding and logistics) to work online. I own a flat in Lisbon; I made money in stocks. I became a British citizen in August 2025; the <strong>public ceremony caused strong anxiety (front row for hours).</strong></p>

  <div class="head">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <div class="meta">Poor communication, I usually listen to people more and pretend that I understand even the joke.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
  <p><strong>My communication skills are poor.</strong> I believe it's due to the time kept by myself. <strong>I don't communicate well personally.</strong> In case of another consultation I'll try my best to go over all points shared on all topics.</p>
<br>
     <p>
  <strong>I don't know how to socialize.</strong>
  <strong>I don't know how to keep a girlfriend for longer than 3 months</strong> (that's the average relationship I have).
  One day a lady fell from the stairs in front of me at work, and <strong>I had no reaction.</strong>
  I simply walked away when I realized she would be fine within minutes, without even asking if she was ok.  
  <strong>I don't get jokes, I'm too literal.</strong>
  Even during phone calls, <strong>I can't understand and interact properly.</strong>  
  <strong>If I ask a question and the other person explains without following the steps from my question, I get confused, anxious, and upset.</strong>  
  So, I take a deep breath and try to relax in order to keep the conversation. <strong>This happens every day, many times during the day.</strong>  
  At work <strong>I need to mask by entering the shop laughing and greeting, even if I don’t feel like it.</strong>  
  <strong>Sometimes I think people are talking about me when they are actually saying something good about me.</strong>  
  <strong>I had discussions with many colleagues in several jobs and with managers.</strong>  
  Even with flatmates, <strong>I had 3 discussions only this year of 2025.</strong>  
  I got a video from 2 days ago that I plan to show during the appointment if possible.
</p>
<br>
     <p> This is a very important part of my life. I used to live on a residential area. After small talks I used to tell my colleagues that I had left my computer on in order to run away from the conversation. There is a whatsapp group with everyone still nowadays because we kind of grew up in the same area. They still joke about me having to turn of the computer. That situation of running away from talks lasted for about 10 years in total from 10y to 20y. </p>
<br>
     <p>I get in trouble a lot because of my traits. for example, the security guy from my workplace tapped my on my shoulder the other day and I told him I don't like touching. I heard him complaining to someone else that I was racist. it takes a huge amount of energy amd a huge effort to fix problems caused by my traits because , for example,  in this case I had to go person by person explaining that when someone touches me when I'm not expecting its really rude to me and I'm extremely sensitive, etc.. but still I don't think most people get it </p>
<br>
     <p><strong>Difficulty knowing when to speak.</strong> On clubhouse app, for example, <strong>I mostly listen; this hinders making friends.</strong> In <em>huddles</em> at work, <strong>I prefer to speak later in private with the manager.</strong> <strong>I avoid speaking with strangers, make little eye contact, and usually avoid going out on days off.</strong></p>
<br>  
  <p>
  There was a bingo at work and I missed it because I did not say “bingo” — I didn’t understand that the word <em>“free”</em> in the middle could be marked at any time. I was waiting for the word to be called. After many names were called, someone else from the group asked about the word “free” and won the bingo.  
  I actually won as well because I recorded the whole thing on my phone and could prove it.  
  If people don’t explain things properly, I can’t do several things — even a simple bingo. I don’t ask questions in groups and I usually mess up. picture below</p>

   <p><strong>Difficulty knowing when to speak.</strong> On Clubhouse app , for example, I <strong>mostly listen; this hinders making friends.</strong> In <em>huddles</em> at work, <strong>I prefer to speak later in private with the manager.</strong> <strong>I avoid speaking with strangers, make little eye contact, and usually avoid going out on days off.</strong></p>
<br>

<p><strong>Coding for up to 12 hours or more, staying up all night</strong> if I have the next day off. <strong>Focused on JavaScript, Google Cloud, and React.js</strong> (I know other programming languages, including Python, Java, PHP, SQL, and C#, and I am familiar with their environments such as Node.js, Unity, and .NET. I also have knowledge of Linux and ethical hacking.). Since the course (April 2023), <strong>this has been my main topic; colleagues sometimes find it repetitive.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>Sometimes <strong>take photos of the backyard</strong> (flatmate’s garden) and <strong>pretend at work that I am engaged in other topics.</strong> <strong>I limit interaction with flatmates to a maximum of 5 minutes.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>I was asked a question during the appointment, and I answered that I <strong>used to tattoo myself</strong> and then pour some vodka over the tattoo while it was still fresh and bleeding, even though it was a practice from years ago. I'll post pictures of me tattooing myself here.</p>
<br>

<p> I am very good at solving problems, and managers often ask for my opinion on important tasks. My interests are always related to logic and problem solving. I'll give an example from today which is also on daily journal. 26/09/25 - My manager was unsure how to organize four shelves of wines by price and country. I suggested using inexpensive colored sticky notes: each color representing a country (e.g., red = Italy, blue = France, yellow = Spain), and marking the expensive items with a black dot. I described it as applying simple logic (“categorization and systematization”) and compared the final arrangement to “playing Tetris” until it fit properly. She found the idea excellent and shared it with other stores in the brand.</p>    
<br>
<p>Lived rent free - breakfast, lunch, dinner included at the hotel for 1 year where I worked and also developed an <strong>integrated ecosystem for the reception</strong> where they had all hotel, cricket, airlines, maps, reception documents integrated.</p>

    <h2>Sensory sensitivities</h2>
    <div class="meta">Sounds, light, touch, startle, linguistic distractions.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
  <p><strong>Sensitive to many sounds/stimuli:</strong> morning magpie, white light, underground, sirens, loud Italian neighbors, birds, and distant conversations. <strong>Dislike of physical touch (e.g., shoulder taps).</strong> Shower and toilet noises can feel hypnotic; sometimes I just sit and watch/listen. I notice details (e.g., rats) that others don’t.</p>
<br>
<p> cigarette smell triggers me a lot. I hate cigarrete smell . it irritates me. If I'm quiet and suddenly there is a cigarrete smell I might start feeling some traits and get irritated. lights get brigther and noises.  I think it might deregulate my brain somehow.</p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>I have noticed that when I move back and forth while sitting down, I feel a pulsing sensation that starts in my back and travels up to my head.</strong> I find that this motion helps me regulate my emotions and provides a sense of balance and calm. It’s a personal sensory experience that seems to help me cope with stress or overwhelming situations.</p>
<br>  
<p>When I was around 8 years old, I was playing hide and seek with my cousin. During the game, her tooth somehow hit and got stuck in my head. When I stood up quickly, it cut me, and a lot of blood came out. <strong>I did not feel any pain at all</strong>; I was only scared because everyone else was frightened by the sight of my face and hands covered in blood. There is still a scar in my head. picture below in this section</p>
<br>
<p><strong>My good hearing both helps and distracts:</strong> if I hear a familiar language nearby, I can daydream and need to breathe and refocus. I speak Portuguese, Spanish, and English; I understand a bit of French and Italian. <strong>I get startled frequently</strong>; on flights (Lisbon roughly every 2 months), I nap and still get startled. Today I was startled by a fly returning from Tesco (headphones in pocket). My room faces the backyard and noises coming from there wake me up during the night. In order to avoid waking up I leave the cooling fan on, ambient music and the socket yellow light on at all times. It stays like that even during the daytime. I don't have a keyboard at the moment. That one was a small gift from my mother and I kept it of course.</p>
<br>
    <p> Colleagues often  make fun of me sometimes for wearing anything instead of going up for shopping. The problem is to have to go far and buy the clothes. I usually wear clothes I buy online or near my place on a cheap place. I don't mind as long as it's confortable. Nothing is branded.</p>
<br>
     <p> I have a problem with relationships. I  don't think much of having a romantic relationship and I don't know how to socialize. I have zero patience for it </p>
     <br>
     <p>When I was about 10 years old, I <strong>punched the wall very hard several times just to feel the pain</strong>. I also <strong>put a wire into both sides of an electrical socket to feel an electric shock</strong>. My father worked as an electrician. The socket exploded, the apartment lost power, and the wire melted in my fingers. I started laughing at it and didn’t really understand how dangerous it was.</p>
<br>  
     <p> I'm frequently tapping my toes inside my shoes. This happens everyday. I also tap my legs with both hands when I get nervous often. I move my left hand but I'm using an anxiety ring on it trying to stop </p>
     <br>
<br>  
     <p> I can have headaches for days. I've been to a hospital when I was a kid because of headache. On the 5th day I was taken to a hospital for exams. Right now I'm with headache and it's been 2  days.</p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>Sometimes I see small flashes, like tiny particles in the air.</strong> I was told they might be “dead cells.” I have always noticed them and thought it was interesting. I mention this because it may be related to how I perceive sensory details. I also feel chest pain; sometimes the small pain goes a bit to the left arm — it happened many times during my life. I first thought it was caused by asthma, then gases, but it keeps showing up. I think it's due to anxiety and that it may cause a real heart attack at some point in the future. <strong>Sometimes I feel I would rather die.</strong></p>
 <br>
     <p>
  Around 8 am, I can hear loudly the airplanes over NW10 because Heathrow is busy with morning arrivals.
  Some planes come from the Chesham stack, flying southeast over Harrow and Edgware before turning toward the airport,
  and others come from the Lambourne stack in Essex, crossing northwest London.
  Large planes like the A380 and Boeing 777 are especially loud.
  The cool morning air allows noise to travel farther, so the planes are easier to hear at this time.I usually wake up by this time in case I had a good sleep and I'm off work.
</p>
<br>
     <p> for example there is a chicago flight united airlines landing at heathrow now at 13:10h Boeing 767-300. It's not as loud as A380 which comes in the morning from africa, middle east and asia. and these go to stack Chesham , rotate , and then  go round the city and around my area NW10 and wake me up in the morning. </p>
     <br>
     <p>27/09/25 This morning I woke up to the sound of planes and ended up recording videos comparing the noise of an A319, A320, and A321. Because of the easterly winds, departures were heading towards London, passing over NW10 at about 4,000 feet. I even managed to capture a Boeing 777 bound for Dallas, so I could compare the sound of smaller Airbus aircraft with the heavier 777. Usually, the long-haul flights to the US depart in a group, and today there were two 777s and a JetBlue A321, all initially heading east towards London before turning 180 degrees to cross the Atlantic. I'm working at 1pm . I woke up several times during the night because of noises at the backyard , front door, cars. I'll try to sleep fora while before going to work

At the same time, the morning birddsong was clear and loud. Around 8 am in NW10, I could hear the robin, blackbird, great tit, and woodpigeon — all singing as the aircraft roared overhead.

Usually, the long-haul flights to the US depart in a group, and today there were two 777s and a JetBlue A321, all initially heading east towards London before turning 180 degrees to cross the Atlantic.</p>
<br>
     <p><strong>I spoke with my parents after getting guidance from Dr. James, a psychiatrist who called me after I visited my GP and told her that I hear voices.</strong> He said he wanted to understand what type of voices they were and whether I had psychosis. <strong>The voices I hear are actually memories—so vivid that I can literally hear them—as well as some of my own thoughts.</p>
 <br>
<p>A therapist (after a GP appointment) told me something similar: “Be yourself, stop masking, relax, and don’t expect everyone to understand.” That advice helped me a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Additional sensory/behavioural notes I want recorded:</strong> I like cold floors. As a child I sometimes ate leaves and rocks. I used to put a coin in my mouth to taste it. A teacher called vivian(portuguese teacher) complained with me when I was at 1st grade because I had a coin in my mouth. I often <strong>sit in unusual positions</strong> (I "sit weird"). I also sometimes <strong>enjoy staying with my head upside down a bit</strong> — these are calming or regulating behaviours for me.</p>
 <br>
<p><strong>I have a collection of Rubik’s cubes here in the UK and another collection in Portugal.</strong> I keep solving them a lot. <strong>Solving Rubik’s cubes regulates my emotions, like a form of therapy.</strong> <strong>Sometimes, when I wake up during the night, I solve the cube a few times.</strong></p>

 <br>
<p><strong>I also have a ring for anxious people that I keep rotating.</strong> Others at work noticed me spinning supermarket baskets sometimes. <strong>I basically spin most objects I come in contact with.</strong> This repetitive motion helps me manage anxiety and self-regulate during stressful situations.</p>

 <br>

    I take pictures of the sky and the sun every time. I can’t sit with others in the break room due to the smell of food. My rooms are dark, lit only by small socket lights. I use different gloves and don’t eat the free fruit (I can’t eat mango, pear, kiwi, grapes, etc.). I captured swallows arriving in the UK from the Sahara in Africa (you might need to zoom in if you’re on a phone, or download and view on a laptop). I am food intolerant (lactose, oats, gluten, etc.). This cheap temu keyboard was a gift, which I kept more as a memory; feeling the weather. I keep telling my colleagues to enjoy the weather.

    <div class="meta">Need for planning; incident in Acton.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Unexpected changes generate intense anxiety. At my last appointment, I cried because I had only 30 minutes to reach a clinic in Acton (new location). I held it together in the waiting room but cried with the doctor, affecting the report. Dr. Mornica suggested rescheduling, but I needed to complete it that day; I don’t leave things for later. I was exhausted after listening to a friend at Costa before the appointment. Dr. Mornica gave me a paper with the help line in case I need it while waiting for the next steps. I haven't called yet. I don't like papers. I took it as I was grateful for the appointment. She kindly received me there on that day as I told her I was off and could go.</p>
 <br>    
    <p>My everyday routine is simple – work, eating the same meal as always, code and sleep. When I'm not coding I tend to study or plan something. I don't really have friends. Rarely receive messages from working colleagues asking if I am ok and I answer yes. I never ask anyone about their lives ( apart from my parents - they live in my apartment in lisbon and we are always in contact ). </p>
 <br>    
    <p>While coding I listen to people talking on social media apps. I never speak to anyone. I usually enter rooms talking about physics, nature, startups, coding.</p>

    <h2>Holidays and flights</h2>
    <div class="meta">Travel routines, EasyJet Luton–Lisbon, A319/A320.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">

     <p>In 2024, during my holidays in Lisbon, my sister organized a BBQ for my birthday and invited everyone from the church as well as her personal friends. I wasn’t expecting this, as I had told them I just wanted my family there. I spent about 30 minutes at the party before leaving, using the excuse of taking an elderly neighbor, my Portuguese neighbor who was also there, home. Everyone got upset, but it wasn’t my fault—I hadn’t invited anyone. The situation was overwhelming for me, and I simply needed to step away. I never liked surprises as stated here    <a href="#y5" style="font-weight: bold; color: #FFD700; text-decoration: underline;">5–10 years</a>
.</p>
 <br>
      <p>When I travel, I usually fly EasyJet from Luton to Lisbon. I know the aircraft types (A319/A320), recognize crews, and even choose specific seats to sleep in. I have taken around 150 flights on this route.

I notice patterns that others don’t. For example, I can tell when different pilots approach Lisbon differently: some make the correct turn over Costa da Caparica and land smoothly, while others turn too far left and only correct just before landing, which feels rough. I also notice differences on other routes, such as whether the approach goes over the Seine River delta in Normandy. I actually memorized the whole flight back and forth and the details.

I am very sensitive to descent. Because of sinus issues, I can usually tell the plane is descending before the pilot announces it, both from the sound and from the direction of turns (e.g. crossing the Channel).

I also notice crew routines. On the last flight of the day, they usually sit and eat at the back seats, which are free; I often choose those seats because it helps me sleep.

I tend to repeat the same pattern of flying (same airline, same route, same time) rather than exploring other places, even though I have flown so many times. </p>

  My brother and sister avoid me. The same goes for my parents, but they are my parents, and I suspect that for this reason they still talk to me a lot. I am very straightforward, and people sometimes get upset because of that.

  After coming back to work from my holidays, three different managers invited me to work with them in different shops, even though I have called in sick quite a lot already. But when I am at work, I always do a really good job.

  This morning, I came to work with my earphones as usual. When I remove my earphones at work, everything sounds so loud. I even get goosebumps from the noise. I don’t know how people can live like this, listening to all that noise all the time.
</p>
<br>
   

<p>
I am not really sure what is going on in my family. Everyone used to talk to me, but now my brother and sister don’t talk to me and don’t like my parents either. In my view, we were all raised properly, including me.

Now they don’t talk to me because I ended up protecting my parents, but I’m not sure if I was right to do that. Sometimes I feel like I don’t understand certain situations, or maybe I understand them too well. I’m not sure. I just try my best to stay at peace with everyone.

For example, I have missed chances with girlfriends because I didn’t understand whether they liked me or not. I have been told that a few times by different women.

  During these holidays in Lisbon, I had a conversation with my mother, who was also my teacher until I was 7 years old. She told me that when I was a child, I used to hit other kids mainly because I did not know how to play with them. She explained that I was often left alone, but academically I always had the best grades. I also used to watch other kids playing football, as I was rarely picked to play. Then, she gave me a keyboard so I could play by myself. I also had some math books, and I used to study in advance before the classes. Playing the keyboard and studying by myself became a habit since then.

  <strong>21/02/26</strong><br>
       I broke my family’s TV. My father sometimes turns the volume up very loud and shouts; I believe this is intentional. During one of these episodes, I threw my phone at the TV. He is aware that I am sensitive to noise. I went to bed afterwards, even though it was still 7 p.m., and I took clonazepam. I had a full day because I am on holiday. I tried to spend time with family members and went out. I do not understand why these situations continue to happen. They affect me negatively.

  This might happen sometimes, but medication helps. For example, yesterday I took clonazepam. 
  I’m on holiday, so it could happen at any time. I sometimes burn my feet by pressing them 
  against the heater. This is triggered by noise, smell, etc. I can get overwhelmed and this is the scape.— my family can be too loud. but this picture is at least 1 month old.

        How am I supposed to contact the help line if my problem has to do with communication? been thinking about it since my first consultation with Dr Mornica. 
     </p> <br>
     <p>
      <strong>15/02/26</strong><br>
      The waiting time for a diagnosis is painful. I’ve been anxious and have been going to doctors since August 2025. I might not be able to wait another six months. I’m even thinking about giving up and leaving the UK for a few months or years before receiving the letter for the next consultation.
