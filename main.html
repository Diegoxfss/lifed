    <h1>Message to My Doctors</h1>
    <p>
      This message is related to my autism assessment. I have already completed two assessments so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      The webpage that was previously available for documentation and tracking purposes has now been taken <span class="strong">offline</span>.
      The associated repository is also set to <span class="strong">private</span>.
      If access is ever needed for review or reference, it can be made available upon request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m not entirely sure whether my doctors are reading or need access to this information, but I wanted to keep it available just in case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the website itself is offline, my daily journal (or diary) will continue to be updated privately every day for ongoing record-keeping and possible future reference.
