    <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>

    <p>
      I reflected on what I spoke about with Doctor Agnish. I am reconsidering my life.
      After running away to different countries and facing many crises, I realised that
      I need to accept myself and move forward. I want to stop running away.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have decided to change the way I dress, the way I speak, and the way I treat
      others. I believe I can achieve better working positions and continue to grow
      professionally and personally.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am committed to building a better quality of life. I learned coping strategies
      that may seem simple, but I had never fully understood or applied them before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking with someone experienced in supporting people with autism has helped
      me significantly. I now better understand my strengths and my limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      My focus moving forward is to build my life around my strengths while protecting
      my limitations. I want to make thoughtful, consistent progress instead of
      reacting to crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
      I plan to open my own business and work toward financial independence. I also
      intend to get my driver’s licence to increase my independence and stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am choosing responsibility, growth, and long-term stability. This is a
      conscious decision to improve my quality of life and move forward with clarity
      and commitment.
